# LOCAL TT APP Reform

## After inspecting the LocalAppTT launched in Trinidad and Tobago it was noted that why offer one feature instead of making a hub to access a variety of services.

## Examples:

          - Internal Services such as SharePoint forms for the overall reduction of paper usage.
          - External Services such as the initial purpose of the app, to report issues in the area.



## Features that need to be adjusted and fixed:
1. Automate reports, manual submission of reports is key time wastage factor. Weekly reports is highly inefficient and is an instant bottleneck to the process.
2. Accounts creation for the respective Corporations to login and update status of report.
3. Should have a range of other forms in one place for the persons outside the intranet to be able to fill so they can easily submit and electronic copy of the document.
4. Oversight to ensure reports submission reflects the correct Corporation and for the most accurate reason.
5. Reports will be reviewed bi-weekly generated reports to determine the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the respective Corporations.
